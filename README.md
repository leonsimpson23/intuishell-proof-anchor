# intuishell-proof-anchor
Authorship and capability anchor for a governed execution environment research system. Contains non-operational materials only.
# IntuiShell — Authorship Anchor Repository

This repository intentionally contains **no functional source code**.

It exists solely to establish dated authorship, research direction, and capability scope of a governed execution environment developed independently by the author.

The underlying system is a authority enforcement boundary that enforces authority, constraint validation, and verification prior to system-level actions.
Operational implementation details, and execution mechanisms are intentionally withheld.

## Purpose of this repository

This repository serves four functions:

1. Establish proof-of-existence at time of publication
2. Provide non-operational architectural description
3. Provide verifiable artifact hashes of the private implementation
4. Allow controlled disclosure under NDA without public exposure

## Important Notice

Nothing in this repository is sufficient to reproduce the system.

This repository intentionally exposes only a verification surface, not the operational system.

## Disclosure Policy

Full technical materials are only available under mutually executed confidentiality agreement.
